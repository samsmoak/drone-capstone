/**
 * Manual's room — drawn on the spot from the two base stations, with the drone
 * in it and the arrow keys round it (2026-10-24, Samuel: "we first detect the
 * two base stations, then we draw that room on the spot, and we show the
 * drone's position in that particular room … and forward, backwards, left and
 * right on the drone, so the user can see that before they press Start, and
 * as they are flying").
 *
 * THE SAME MAP AS AUTO'S MISSION PLANNER (auto/plan/RoomMap.tsx): 2-D or 3-D,
 * the tripods with their channels, the origin and Forward, the green space.
 * Nothing is drawn by hand — no room, no path, no points:
 *
 *   the room    where the measured stations' light reaches, over the agent's
 *               flying area (agent GET /station/space — the same prediction
 *               as Auto's ③ green, without a room)
 *   the drone   live, 2.5× its Auto size, its trail since the window opened
 *   the keys    F / B / L / R round it: where ↑ ↓ ← → move it NOW, which is
 *               never along the nose (keyArrows.ts, lib/keyDirections.ts);
 *               the nose is its own red tick
 *
 * Shown, not enforced: the green is where the position can be trusted, not a
 * fence the guard holds the drone inside (the guard's area is the square).
 *
 * Without a position — the stations not heard — the drone cannot be placed,
 * so a compass takes its place: ↑ at the top, the nose turning with the drone.
