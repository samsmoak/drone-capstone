/**
 * Control: sign in, run the checks, confirm the area, then fly.
 *
 * TWO COLUMNS, above the `lg` breakpoint:
 *
 *   left   the console — how the drone is sitting, what we asked it to do, what
 *          it is reporting, what it can see, and where it is in the room
 *   right  the controls — the action rail, then whatever this step allows
 *
 * Below `lg` they stack, controls first: at the window's 720 px minimum width
 * (tauri.conf.json) two halves would be about 230 px each, which is unusable.
 * The controls are first in the DOM for that reason and ordered back to the
 * right on wide screens.
 *
 * The order of the flow is deliberate and the agent enforces it too — this page
 * only shows what is possible at each step:
 *
 *   signed out → idle → checks → confirm the area → ready → flying
 *
 * A flight that ends abnormally (a tumble, a guard, an emergency stop) puts
 * Retry in place of the flying controls: every check again, in this session,
 * before anything can fly — the drone holds its motors after a tumble.
 *
 * Auto shows the preset programs; Manual shows arming and the keys. Both run
 * the same checks and need the same confirmation, because the risk is the same.

 * keys are *held* and the agent runs the 50 Hz loop from that; a click has no
 * hold, so a clickable key would either do nothing or need a second control path
 * into the flight loop. They light from `intent`, which is the same state the
