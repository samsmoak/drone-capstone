# Roadmap

100 stages from empty repo to demo. Tick them off as they land.

Ordering is by dependency and by risk: the agent comes first because everything
else needs its data shapes, and Tauri comes last because it needs `rustup` and
is the only piece that can be cut without losing the capstone.

Legend: `[x]` done · `[ ]` not started · **⚠** blocked on something external.

## Phase 4 — Safety  ✅

31. [x] `safety/occupancy.py` — load YAML + PGM occupancy grid
32. [x] World coordinates → map cells
33. [x] Bresenham line check between two points
34. [x] `safety/geofence.py` — axis-aligned bounds check
35. [x] Reject waypoints outside bounds, with the reason
36. [x] Reject paths crossing blocked cells
37. [x] Tests: geofence accepts inside, rejects outside, rejects on the boundary
38. [x] Tests: Bresenham finds a wall between two clear points
39. [x] Wire safety checks into `flight/missions.py` before any `goto`

## Phase 5 — Missions  ✅

40. [x] `flight/missions.py` — `Mission` model, ordered waypoints
41. [x] `hover`, `lawnmower`, `waypoint` as mission types
42. [x] Lawnmower generator — area, step, altitude layers → waypoints
43. [x] Dry-run mode: validate and print, never arm
44. [x] Abort handling — land on exception, on Ctrl+C, on critical voltage
45. [x] Mission progress events (`started`, `waypoint_reached`, `landed`, `aborted`)
46. [x] Tests: lawnmower covers the area with no gaps
47. [x] Tests: abort mid-mission still lands
48. [x] `cropwatcher mission --file plan.json`

## Phase 6 — Supabase schema  ✅

49. [x] `supabase/config.toml`, local dev via `supabase start`
50. [x] `migrations/0001_init.sql` — `profiles`, `drones`
51. [x] `flights` table — one row per flight, status, started/ended
52. [x] `telemetry` table — FK to flight, indexed on `(flight_id, recorded_at)`
53. [x] `missions` table — the queue: `queued`/`claimed`/`running`/`done`/`failed`
54. [x] `predictions` table — zone health output
55. [x] `zones` table — greenhouse grid definition
56. [x] RLS on every table, deny by default
57. [x] Policy: authenticated users read their own org's data
58. [x] Policy: only the agent role may claim a mission
59. [x] `claim_next_mission()` RPC — atomic, avoids two agents taking one job
60. [x] Realtime enabled on `telemetry` and `missions`
61. [ ] `seed.sql` — one greenhouse, a zone grid, a demo flight (zones, a drone and a user are seeded; **no flight** is)
62. [x] Generate `types/database.ts` from the schema

## Phase 7 — Agent ↔ Supabase  ✅

63. [x] `sync/client.py` — Supabase client from env, fails loudly if unset
64. [x] `sync/poller.py` — claim → execute → report, outbound only
65. [x] Backoff when the queue is empty; never hammer
66. [x] Mark a mission failed with its reason, never leave it `claimed`
67. [x] Resume safely after an agent restart (stale claim reclaim)
68. [x] `SupabaseSink` wired into live flights
69. [x] Tests: poller claims exactly one mission with two agents running
70. [x] Tests: a failed flight marks the mission failed, not stuck

## Phase 8 — Agent HTTP + WebSocket  ✅

71. [x] `api/rest.py` — FastAPI app, `/health`, `/status`, `/preflight`
72. [x] `POST /flight/mission`, `POST /flight/stop`
73. [x] Manual control socket — `/ws/manual` in `api/rest.py`, loop in `api/manual.py`
74. [x] Browser sends intent; agent generates 50 Hz setpoints itself
75. [x] Heartbeat — auto-land after 0.5 s of silence
76. [x] Bind to localhost by default; LAN only behind an explicit flag
77. [ ] Telemetry broadcast over the same socket (not built: the socket reports only `{state, thrust}`, and manual control starts no telemetry reader)
78. [x] Tests: dropped heartbeat triggers land
79. [x] Tests: malformed control frame is rejected, not crashed on

## Phase 9 — Web foundation

80. [x] `pnpm create next-app` — Next 16, React 19, TS strict, Tailwind v4
81. [x] Copy-adapt `lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`
82. [x] Copy-adapt `.env.example` with the service-role warning
83. [x] `app/globals.css` — tokens on `:root`, raw hex only in definitions, dark theme
84. [x] Google OAuth — `app/auth/callback`, middleware gating
85. [x] `lib/queries.ts` (`server-only` + React `cache`) and `lib/mutations.ts`
86. [x] Zustand store — live telemetry, socket status, manual state only
87. [x] Four async states on every surface: loading, empty, error+retry, content
88. [ ] PWA manifest + icons (no manifest exists)

## Phase 10 — Web features

89. [x] Dashboard — latest flight, battery, zone summary
90. [x] Live telemetry page via Supabase Realtime
91. [x] Flight path map from `x_m`/`y_m`
92. [x] Time series — one chart per unit, table view on each
93. [x] Mission planner — click zones, review, queue
94. [x] Manual control page — keyboard, connects to the agent socket
95. [x] Run comparison across flights
96. [x] Zone health map (renders predictions; none exist until 97–98)

### Added after review — the visitor-facing manual

The original page list had no setup guide, which left the Owner's Manual PDF as
the only instructions. Added:

- [x] `/setup` — numbered walkthrough, live agent-status banner, and a
      troubleshooting list written symptom-first from real bring-up failures
- [x] `/setup/hardware` — every kit component photographed, including why most
      sensors are invisible
- [x] Download buttons wired to Supabase Storage (show "coming soon" until CI uploads a build)

## Phase 11 — ML

97. [ ] Port the notebook's feature extraction into `telemetry/features.py`
98. [ ] Load `best_lnn_stable.pt`, infer after correction, write to `predictions`

## Phase 12 — Desktop + ship

99. [x] Tauri app — manual control window, agent bundled as a PyInstaller sidecar (macOS arm64 built and verified locally)
100. [ ] GitHub Actions — build macOS `.dmg` + Windows `.exe` on tag (workflow written; never run)

### Keyboard control (Tauri manual window)

Keys mirror `keyboard_fly.py` from the bring-up session, which flew.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` | pitch — forward / back |
| `←` `→` | roll — left / right |
| `W` `S` | thrust — up / down |
| `A` `D` | yaw — rotate left / right |
| `P` | **cut motors immediately** |
| `Q` | land gently and disarm |

Rules the implementation must honour:

- **The browser sends held-key state, never one command per keypress.** The
  agent generates the 50 Hz setpoint stream itself. A key-per-packet design
  breaks the moment one packet is late, and the commander cuts out below ~10 Hz.
- **Thrust decays toward zero whenever `W` is not held**, so releasing the
  keyboard brings the drone down rather than leaving it pinned at power.
- **Heartbeat at 10 Hz; auto-land after 0.5 s of silence.** Covers a closed tab,
  a frozen browser, a lost socket.
- `P` is checked before anything else in the frame, so a panic stop is never
  queued behind a movement.
- Keys are repeated OS-level while held — track key *state* (down/up events),
  not the repeat stream, or the rate is at the mercy of the OS repeat delay.
- Show every binding on screen. A manual-control surface whose keys are not
  visible is a crash waiting to happen.

## Verification gates

Run before calling any phase done, and report pass/fail/skipped honestly:

```bash
cd backend/agent && source .venv/bin/activate
ruff check . && mypy cropwatcher && pytest      # agent

cd web && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm build   # web
```

Hardware verification needs the Crazyradio plugged in:

```bash
cropwatcher check                          # preflight only, no motors
cropwatcher hover --height 0.3 --secs 30   # reproduce the 25 s held hover
```
