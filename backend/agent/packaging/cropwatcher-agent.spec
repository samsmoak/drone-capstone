"""PyInstaller spec for the agent sidecar.

Two classes of dependency here that static analysis cannot see on its own, and
each one fails at runtime rather than at build time — which is why they are
listed explicitly instead of being discovered when a drone will not connect.

1. **uvicorn's protocol and loop implementations.** uvicorn selects them by
   string name at startup, so nothing imports them where PyInstaller can see
   it. Left out, the frozen binary starts and then cannot serve a request.

2. **libusb.** cflib reaches the radio through `libusb_package`, which ships a
   native `libusb-1.0.dylib` beside its Python source. That package registers
   its own PyInstaller hook, so the dylib is collected automatically — but it
   is asserted in `packaging/verify_sidecar.py` rather than assumed, because a
   missing dylib is invisible until a radio is plugged in.

Built via `packaging/build_sidecar.sh`, which names the output with the target
triple Tauri expects of an `externalBin`.
