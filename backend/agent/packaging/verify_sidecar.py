"""Prove a frozen sidecar actually works, before it ships inside an installer.

Bundling failures in this binary are silent. PyInstaller reports success, the
executable starts, and then the one thing that matters — reaching a USB radio,
or upgrading a WebSocket — fails on a user's laptop with a traceback they
cannot act on. Every check here exists because its absence is invisible until
hardware or a user is in the room:

  runs            the bootloader and the Python runtime are intact
  usb             libusb loaded and enumerated the bus; cflib's native
                  dependency is the one PyInstaller cannot see by itself
  health          uvicorn serves HTTP
  websocket       uvicorn's websockets implementation is bundled; it is
                  selected by string name, so nothing imports it statically
  exits           closing stdin stops the agent and frees its port — the only
                  signal that reaches the real Python process (see below)

The `usb` check is the subtle one. With no dongle plugged in, a *correct*
binary reports "no drone found" and a *broken* one reports a missing libusb
backend. Both are failures of the command and both exit non-zero, so the exit
code proves nothing — this asserts on which message came back.

The `exits` check is the one that strands a drone. A one-file binary is two
processes, and killing the first leaves the second holding the radio
(rest.py, exit_when_parent_closes). It is proven here on every OS CI builds,
not only on the Mac it was first measured on.

Slow machines are expected, not failures: a one-file binary unpacks ~40 MB
before Python starts, and an older Intel Mac took longer than the 20 s this
used to allow. The limits are generous, and the wait ends early — with the
agent's own output — the moment the process dies, so a crash is never
reported as a timeout.

Run through `build_sidecar.py`, which runs it on every build, or directly:
