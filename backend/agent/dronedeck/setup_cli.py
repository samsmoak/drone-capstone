"""`dronedeck setup` — put the drone's software on it from a terminal.

The Set up page's engine (drone_setup.DroneSetup), run as a command: the same
check, the same parts in the same order, the same battery unplug, the same
verification and marker. The Set up page shows this command to copy rather
than an Install button (2026-10-24, Samuel: "put it in a command — which the
user can run and get the firmware on the drone"), so an install is something
you watch run, with every step printed, not a button whose progress hides in
a page.

THE RADIO HAS ONE OWNER. While DroneDeck is open its agent holds the
Crazyradio, and a second program cannot reach the drone — it would report "no
drone" and mislead. So this checks first whether DroneDeck's agent answers
and, if it does, says to quit it.

    dronedeck setup                          check, then install what is needed
    dronedeck setup --check                  check only; change nothing
    dronedeck setup --reinstall camera,wifi  write those parts again too

Installed app, no Python: the app's own agent binary is the whole CLI
(packaging/sidecar.py) — `…/DroneDeck.app/Contents/MacOS/dronedeck-agent
setup`. GET /setup/command gives this machine's exact line (command_line).
