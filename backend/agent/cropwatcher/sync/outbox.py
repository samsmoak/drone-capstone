"""Records waiting to reach Supabase.

Everything the agent needs to remember is written here **before** any network
call: the drone it met, the session, each flight, and every audit event. A
laptop with no internet flies exactly as well as one with internet; the records
sit in this folder until a sync succeeds, and are removed only once the server
has them.

One file per record, named by its id, written atomically (temp file + rename),
so a crash mid-write cannot leave a half-record — the same reason the CSV is
flushed every row.

Ids are generated **here**, not by the database. A flight that happens offline
already has the id its telemetry rows reference, so uploading later needs no
translation and re-uploading changes nothing (CLAUDE.md #6).
