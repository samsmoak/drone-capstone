"""The agent's local HTTP and WebSocket API.

This is what the desktop app talks to. It binds to **localhost by default**: it
can arm a real drone, so exposing it on a network is an explicit, deliberate
act — and even on localhost every command needs the local control token, since
any page the operator has open can reach 127.0.0.1.

Two surfaces, split by how much delay each tolerates:

  REST       commands. One request, delay is harmless.
  WebSocket  the live stream out (telemetry, session state, checks) and the
             manual-control intent in. Needs 10 Hz and cannot cross the
             internet.

What is deliberately **not** here any more: `POST /flight/mission` and
`/preflight` used to fly a drone with no authentication of any kind, and they
bypassed the checks. Flying now goes through a session, which needs the token,
a signed-in operator, passing checks and a confirmed area.

    A PyInstaller one-file binary is **two** processes: a bootloader that
    unpacks the archive, and the real Python process it then spawns. Measured
    from the built app:

        desktop(43661) → bootloader(43666) → python(43670)   ← holds the radio

    Tauri knows only about the bootloader. Killing it leaves the Python process
    orphaned onto `launchd`, still holding the radio and the port. The next
    launch then reports "no drone found" with a drone plainly sitting there.

    Stdin is the fix because it is the one handle the real process inherits:
    when the parent dies its pipe closes, and the read below returns EOF in the
    process that actually matters. The session is ended first — this path can
    run while the drone is in the air — but within `deadline_s`: noticing the
    parent is gone is only half of it; the exit must happen whatever the
