"""An operating session: one operator, one drone, from sign-in to sign-off.

This is what the desktop app drives, and the only thing that flies a drone.

    sign_in            who is responsible for what follows
    start              connect, then the checks, one step at a time
    confirm_area       the operator says the drone is on the floor and clear
    health_test        the firmware's motor and battery tests (motors spin, briefly)
    retry              after an abnormal end: every check again, same session
    run_program        Auto: a preset flight, e.g. the hover test
    run_mission        Auto: a saved mission, flown by the mission controller
                       through the manual flight system
    arm_manual         Manual: props idle, then assisted flight from the keys
    land / stop        graceful landing, or the deliberate emergency stop
    end                land if flying, close the flight, upload what is left

Everything long-running happens on a worker thread and reports progress as
events, so the app can show a live checklist instead of a frozen button.

Rules this file exists to hold in one place:

- **Nothing flies until the checks pass and the operator confirms the area.**
- **Nothing flies without a signed-in operator**, so every flight and every
  action has a person attached.
- **Only one activity at a time.** The radio is single-user (a concurrent scan
  produced `[Errno 19] No such device` in the lab).
- **A flight always ends in a landing or a stop**, including when an exception
  escapes: the drone must never be left in the air.
- **After an abnormal end, nothing flies until Retry.** A tumble leaves the
  firmware holding the motors; arming past that is a flight with no thrust.
