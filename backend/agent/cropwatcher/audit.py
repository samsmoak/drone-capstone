"""Who did what, with which drone, and what happened.

Every operator action and every automatic safety decision is recorded here, so
the web's audit page can answer "who flew this, and why did it end?" for all
time. Events are written to the outbox first and uploaded by the sync, which
means a flight with no internet is still fully accounted for.

Events are **append-only**: the database has no update or delete policy for
them, operators included.
