"""The checks an operator watches before any flight, one step at a time.

This is preflight for a *session*: it runs on the session's single connection
and single telemetry stream, and it reports each step as it happens so the
desktop app can show a live checklist instead of a spinner followed by a
verdict.

Two holes in the original preflight let the lab crash of 2026-09-16 through,
and both are closed here:

1. It counted base stations with stored geometry, not stations being received.
   Positioning is now judged by :func:`assess_positioning`.
2. It waited for **z** to settle and never looked at x or y — which wandered
   8.9 m at rest with no base station signal. Settling now covers all three
   axes.

**A positioning problem warns; it does not refuse.** A base station that is off
is a recommendation, because the person standing over the drone can see it and
decide. What a warning changes is what the drone is trusted to do: the report
comes back ``assisted=False``, which costs the height hold, the preset programs
and every guard that reads a position. Only the two things the drone itself
refuses — no telemetry, ``sys.canfly``, and a supervisor holding the motors
after a crash — still stop a session outright.

The governing rule is unchanged: where the drone publishes its own verdict
(``sys.canfly``), read it; never re-derive it from an invented threshold.
