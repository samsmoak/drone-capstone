"""One connection to one drone — the only way anything in the agent flies.

Before this, five paths could move the drone: the CLI's ``hover``, ``goto`` and
``mission``, the ``poll`` loop, and an unauthenticated REST endpoint. All of
them used a flight object that slept through its waits without watching
anything. Now there is one path:

    DroneLink.open()            connect, configure, start the telemetry stream
      .checks()                 the live preflight checklist → ReadyReport
      .prop_test()              the firmware's propeller test
      .health_test()            propellers, then the battery under load
      .guarded_flight(report)   autonomous flight, every wait watched
      .manual(report)           the assisted manual controller
    DroneLink.close()           stop the stream, stop the motors, close the link

The desktop session and the CLI both use it, so the safety behaviour exercised
in the lab is the behaviour of every caller.
