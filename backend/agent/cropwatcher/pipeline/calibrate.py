"""Calibration against a KNOWN heat source — the hand-warmer flights (story
4.6, "define normal thresholds"). `cropwatcher calibrate`.

The classifier's minimums (blocks.MIN_EVENT_C / MIN_EVENT_HPA) and the
interpreter's severity factors (findings.WARNING_FACTOR / CRITICAL_FACTOR) are
PROVISIONAL: they were measured on normal flights only — how much a flight
wanders when nothing is there (ml/anomaly-eval/MEASUREMENTS.txt). What a real
heat source does to this sensor has never been measured. This measures it:

  1. Fly a mission with a hand warmer (or any steady heat source) placed at one
     inspection point, at the height the drone holds there. Note the point.
  2. `cropwatcher calibrate --flight <id> --at P2` (repeat --flight/--at for
     several flights; the more, the firmer the numbers).
  3. For each marked point it reports what the sensor saw there — the largest
     departure from the flight's own cooling curve while holding, in °C and in
     noise units — and whether the current settings find it and how severe they
     call it. Over the rest of the same flights it reports the most a block
     wanders with nothing there.
  4. It RECOMMENDS constants with the measurements behind them, and saves the
     report to <data folder>/calibration/. It never edits the code: changing a
     threshold is a reviewed change, cited in MEASUREMENTS.txt.

Nothing here flies, connects or uploads.
