"""PELT: the optimal split of a series into blocks of constant mean.

Killick, Fearnhead & Eckley (2012), "Optimal detection of changepoints with a
linear computational cost", JASA 107(500). Minimises

    Σ over blocks of Σ (y − the block's mean)²  +  penalty × (number of changes)

exactly, pruning split points that can never be optimal again. Written here in
numpy — the pipeline's runtime dependencies stay numpy, OpenCV and ONNX
Runtime — and checked against the `ruptures` package (Pelt, model "l2") in
tests/pipeline/test_classify.py, which agrees breakpoint for breakpoint.
