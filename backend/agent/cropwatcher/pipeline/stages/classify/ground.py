"""The ground classifier — stage 3 for a SESSION: the stretches of a session
when the drone sat on the ground (before, between and after its flights), at
one reading a second.

WHY A SECOND CLASSIFIER. blocks@1 judges a flight against the board COOLING in
the propellers' air, at 10 Hz. On the ground the motors are off and the board
does the opposite — the electronics warm it, towards a level it settles at —
and the session records once a second. The model is the same family (a
first-order curve, T∞ + A·e^(−t/τ), which fits warming as well as cooling, and
a robust line for pressure), fitted over each ground stretch on its own, so a
flight's cooling never counts as a ground event.

WHAT IT LEAVES OUT. Every reading in or within GROUND_SETTLE_S of a flight
(the flights have results of their own, at ten times the rate), and stretches
shorter than MIN_GROUND_READINGS. On the ground the height does not change, so
pressure is judged as measured ("linear, on the ground").

The block-finding is blocks@1's own — PELT on the residual, Z_EVENT × σ AND a
physical minimum — with numbers measured at 1 Hz on the lab's sessions
(ml/session-eval/MEASUREMENTS.txt): the shortest block (MIN_GROUND_BLOCK), the
gap that ends a run, and the minimum departures (the most a normal session's
ground blocks wander).
