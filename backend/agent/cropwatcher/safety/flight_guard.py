"""Is it safe to fly, and is it safe to keep flying?

Two questions, one module, both answered from the live telemetry stream.

**Before flight** — :func:`assess_positioning`. The lab crash of 2026-09-16 is
why this exists. Preflight counted ``lighthouse.bsAvailable`` (base stations the
drone holds *geometry* for: 4) and reported "4 base stations" while
``lighthouse.bsReceive`` — stations actually being received — was empty. The
drone flew on dead reckoning: at rest its x/y estimate wandered 8.9 m, and in
the air it flew sideways into the room. Readiness is now judged on reception,
per-station calibration and geometry, and the filter's own uncertainty.

**During flight** — :class:`FlightGuard`. The hover loop printed an estimate
that fell to −5.2 m below the floor and kept holding. Every sample is now
checked, and the answer is one of three:

- ``OK``   keep going
- ``LAND`` graceful landing — the estimate is still trustworthy enough to fly it
- ``STOP`` stop the motors — the estimate itself is gone, so a "landing" would
  steer by a position that does not exist. That is what flew the drone into
  the room. A short drop from hover height is the lesser harm.

The thresholds below are *safety policy*, not firmware facts, and are named so
they can be tuned from flight data. Where the firmware publishes its own
verdict (``pm.state`` low power, the supervisor's tumble flag) that is used.

# One base station is enough to FLY: Lighthouse V2 sweeps two angles from a
# single unit and the deck's four sensors resolve a pose from them. Measured
# 2026-09-22 in the cage — one station, drone at rest, position held to
# sub-millimetre with varPX at 0.0001 m² (1 cm).
#
# Two is still better, and what the kit was built around: a second station is
# a second viewpoint, so an occluded deck has somewhere else to look. With one,
# losing sight of it leaves x and y as the accelerometer integrating — measured
# the same day diverging at about 1 m/s, reaching 18 m in seconds. This drone
# has nothing to coast on: deck.bcFlow2 = 0 and deck.bcZRanger2 = 0, both read
# off the drone, so there is no optical flow and no rangefinder.
#
# The default is what the room actually has. A stricter room asks for two with
# CROPWATCHER_MIN_STATIONS=2.

    to look when its deck is occluded.

    ZERO IS NOT AN OPTION HERE, and not because of caution. With no station
    there is no position at all, so there is nothing for a position to be held
    against — the commanded point in flight/manual.py cannot be seeded, the
    geofence has nothing to measure and the drift guard has nothing to compare.
