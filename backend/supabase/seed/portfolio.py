"""Fill the public portfolio: the team, their photos, and starter projects.

Run once against a project that has migration 0007:

    SUPABASE_API=https://<ref>.supabase.co SUPABASE_SERVICE=<secret key> \\
    python backend/supabase/seed/portfolio.py --samuel-photo "<path to headshot.png>"

Uses the SECRET key, so it runs on a developer's machine only — never commit
the key, never ship this. Idempotent: team members are matched by name and
projects by slug, so re-running updates rather than duplicates. It overwrites
the fields it sets, so once someone edits a project in /admin, edit there.

The projects are starter content drawn from this repository's own docs, for the
team to rewrite in the admin. Team roles, emails and websites that were not
given are left blank rather than invented.
