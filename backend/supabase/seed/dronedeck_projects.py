"""Publish the DroneDeck project pages: an overview and one page per part.

    SUPABASE_API=https://<ref>.supabase.co SUPABASE_SERVICE=<secret key> \\
    python backend/supabase/seed/dronedeck_projects.py            # show the plan
    ... python backend/supabase/seed/dronedeck_projects.py --apply    # write it

The six parts are the six our Project Management Planning document divides
the work into (web/public/docs/dronedeck-project-management-planning.pdf):
every user story, owner, estimate and acceptance criterion below is from it,
and every "built" is something in this repository today (2026-09-28).

What it writes, and nothing else:

  - seven `projects` rows, matched by slug: created if missing, updated if
    present. The team edits them in /admin afterwards; re-running this
    overwrites those edits, so re-run it only to restore these versions.
  - their `project_members` rows, from the people already in team_members
    (matched by slug — nobody is created, renamed or re-photographed).
  - the six starter projects from seed/portfolio.py set to `draft`: hidden,
    not deleted, and republished from /admin with one click.

It never touches `design-document` (the team's own design document, entered
in /admin) or anything outside `projects` and `project_members`.

Uses the SECRET key, so it runs on a developer's machine only — never commit
the key. Unlike seed/portfolio.py it does not touch the team: that script
matches people by name, and a name edited in /admin would be re-created.
